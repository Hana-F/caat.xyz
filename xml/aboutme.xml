        Hello! My name is a Hana (or Caat), and I love messing around with computers.
        I use mostly use C++ with some x86 Assembly, but I do know C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        If you would like to contact me, I would prefer you to do so via Discord, but you can tweet me or add me on Steam if you like.
        Do keep in mind that I do use Central Time.
